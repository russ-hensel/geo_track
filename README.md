Working but very rough.  Code base full of dead code, new version soon or on request.

So what does it do?

Given a set of photos with exif geolocation data it will take all the coordinates and
plot on a folium html map, or on google earth.  This can give you a track of a vacation
where you took a set of photos.  Plot is in the form of a line.  You can zoom out
to see the earth or in to see on the scale of a meter or two.

There is no install.  It is for python coders.  Download into your python
environment.  Have python 10 installed.  Run untill an import fails, then
install the missing module.  At some point I will make a list.  Should take
on the order of 1/2 hour to get up and running.

Having trouble?  Message me and I will help.
