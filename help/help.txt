Understanding the Process
	
	For photo input ( can be a directory to scan, a list of photos, or data saved from previous
	input of photos )
        You can have the program get this information in one of several ways.
            *Make up a file with a list of file-names of your pictures
            *Select a picture in a directory with many files, the application
              will scan for other pictures
            *From a gpx type file, this file can come from several sources:
            ......
    
    
    Output can take the following forms:
    
        A map in your web browser.
        A so called kmz file opened in Google Earth ( if you have Google Earth on your computer )
        
        Secondary outputs:
            is to take the list of files that the program has found
            and add them to a txt file that can later be used as an input source or any other
            use you might have for it.
            * An Html file with the map  
            * Kmz file for gooogle earth ( or other app )
